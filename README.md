# UCLA QCBio Collaboratory workshop W17: Machine learning with Python
Author: Wenbin Guo \
Last Update: 2023 Spring


## Description
This intermediate workshop offers an in-depth introduction to machine learning concepts and algorithms, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical skills. Participants will explore supervised and unsupervised learning, learn essential principles of model training and evaluation, and gain hands-on experience with the popular `scikit-learn` package (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). By the end of the workshop, attendees will understand the rationale behind key machine learning algorithms and gain experience in building, evaluating, and applying models to real-world data.
